# Adam Behun - Software in Healthcare | Deliver Outcomes, Not Tools

Below are my key projects (Both on Healthcare - Provider Side), Prior Authorization LLM Agent & Dental Kiosk, followed by my data analysis work.

## **[Prior Authorization AI Voice Agent](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/MyRobot)**
A voice-enabled bot for automating prior authorization in healthcare. Built with:
- **FastAPI**: High-performance, async backend for handling Twilio webhooks.
- **Twilio**: Manages calls to `+18666105909` with escalation to `+15165667132`.
- **ElevenLabs**: Realistic text-to-speech and speech-to-text for human-like interactions.
- **xAIâ€™s Grok 3**: Conversational AI for processing and responding to user queries.
- **Supabase**: Real-time database logging, viewable at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Next.js**: Frontend for displaying authorization logs.

**Impact**: Streamlines insurance approvals, reduces manual work for PPM and ASC staff, and ensures HIPAA-compliant mock data for testing.

## **[Dental Kiosk](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/DentalKiosk)**  
A patient-facing kiosk for dental practices (DSO settings) to manage appointments and payments. Features:
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for consistent backend/frontend setup.
- **Stripe**: Secure payment processing with webhook integration.
- **Next.js**: Responsive frontend for patient interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores appointment and payment data.

**Impact**: Simplifies patient check-ins, reduces front-desk workload, and enhances payment workflows in dental practices.
