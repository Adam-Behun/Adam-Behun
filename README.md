# Adam Behun - Data Analysis Portfolio

Graduating in May of 2024, I am a senior student of Business Analytics and Computer Science. The below are some of my data analysis projects. 

## [Using Supervised ML to Predict Tipping Patterns](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/supervised-ml-to-predict-tips)

Analyzed over 55 million rides to predict tipping patterns in New York City's taxi service. 
#### Key findings:
- **Zone Hotspots**: Recognizing areas with high demand to enhance taxi availability and reduce passenger wait times.
- **Yearly Trends**: Making monthly comparisons to illustrate the impact of external events on service usage.
- **Daily Traffic Volumes**: Identifying peak hours to recommend optimal driver schedules and fleet management.

## [SQL Preparation](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/sql-preparation)
<p>
Learnings from <a href="https://josephmachado.gumroad.com/l/analyticalsql">Efficient Data Processing in SQL</a> as well as solutions to HackerRank challenges.

Each link leads to a SQL file within the `sql-queries` directory that demonstrates how to use that specific type of join.

- [INNER JOIN](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/sql-preparation/blob/master/analytical-data-processing-sql/sql-queries/inner-join.sql)
- [LEFT JOIN](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/sql-preparation/blob/master/analytical-data-processing-sql/sql-queries/left-join.sql)
- [RIGHT JOIN](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/sql-preparation/blob/master/analytical-data-processing-sql/sql-queries/right-join.sql)
- [FULL OUTER JOIN](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/sql-preparation/blob/master/analytical-data-processing-sql/sql-queries/full-outer-join.sql)
- [CROSS JOIN](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/sql-preparation/blob/master/analytical-data-processing-sql/sql-queries/cross-join.sql)
