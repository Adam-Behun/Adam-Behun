# Adam Behun - Software in Healthcare | Deliver Outcomes, Not Tools

Below are my key projects (Both on Healthcare - Provider Side), Prior Authorization LLM Agent & Dental Kiosk, followed by my data analysis work. Alfons and Dental Kiosk are not yet viewable online but are expected to be completed by July 2025.

## Alfons - Prior Authorization Bot
**[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/alfons)**  
A voice-enabled bot for automating prior authorization in healthcare (not yet viewable online, expected completion July 2025). Built with:
- **FastAPI**: High-performance, async backend for handling Twilio webhooks.
- **Twilio**: Manages calls to `sample_number` with escalation to `sample_number`.
- **ElevenLabs**: Realistic text-to-speech and speech-to-text for human-like interactions.
- **xAIâ€™s Grok 3**: Conversational AI for processing and responding to user queries.
- **Supabase**: Real-time database logging
- **Next.js**: Frontend for displaying authorization logs.

**Impact**: Streamlines insurance approvals, reduces manual work for PPM and ASC staff, and ensures HIPAA-compliant mock data for testing.

## Dental Kiosk
**[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/dental-kiosk)**  
A patient-facing kiosk for dental practices (DSO settings) to manage appointments and payments (not yet viewable online, expected completion July 2025). Features:
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for consistent backend/frontend setup.
- **Stripe**: Secure payment processing with webhook integration.
- **Next.js**: Responsive frontend for patient interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores appointment and payment data.

**Impact**: Simplifies patient check-ins, reduces front-desk workload, and enhances payment workflows in dental practices.

## Analyzed 55 million rides to predict tipping patterns in New York City's taxi service
**[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/supervised-ml-to-predict-tips)**  
**Key findings:**
- **Zone Hotspots**: Recognizing areas with high demand to enhance taxi availability and reduce passenger wait times.
- **Yearly Trends**: Making monthly comparisons to illustrate the impact of external events on service usage.
- **Daily Traffic Volumes**: Identifying peak hours to recommend optimal driver schedules and fleet management.
