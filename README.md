# Adam Behun - Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing a comprehensive range of data analytics projects that demonstrate my ability to derive meaningful insights from large datasets and predict trends that are vital for business strategy and operations.

## Pinned Repositories

### [Supervised ML to Predict Tips](https://github.com/Adam-Behun/supervised-ml-to-predict-tips)

This repository features a deep dive into New York City's taxi service data, analyzing over 55 million rides to predict tipping patterns. Key findings such as Zone Hotspots and Yearly Trends not only underscore the value of data-driven decision-making in urban transport but also highlight the potential of machine learning in shaping the future of service delivery and operational efficiency. In this project, I utilized data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to uncover:

- **Zone Hotspots**: Recognizing areas with high demand to enhance taxi availability and reduce passenger wait times.
- **Yearly Trends**: Making monthly comparisons to illustrate the impact of external events on service usage.
- **Daily Traffic Volumes**: Identifying peak hours to recommend optimal driver schedules and fleet management.
